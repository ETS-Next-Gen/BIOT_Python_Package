# BIOT

This package implements Best Interpretable Orthogonal Transformation (BIOT), which is a method that can be used to explain the dimensions of embeddings generated by Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). 

BIOT is a generalization of the method Best Interpretable Rotation (BIR) (for more information about BIR, see https://github.com/AdrienBibal/BIR). BIOT is different from BIR with respect to 3 main points:
* BIOT can be applied to embeddings with more than two dimensions;
* Orthogonal transformations are used instead of rotations;
* Iterative optimization is used instead of performing an exhaustive search in a highly non-convex space.

This results in a method that converges automatically, that performs more transformations and, most importantly, that can now explain MDS embeddings/mappings with any number of dimensions (instead of only two, which is the case for BIR).

This code was written by Rebecca Marion.
